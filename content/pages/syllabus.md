Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 1 or 2 sessions / week; 1 hour / session

Combined Lectures/Labs: 2 sessions / week; 1.5 hours / session

Course Description
------------------

This course provides an introduction to linear systems, transfer functions, and Laplace transforms. It covers stability and feedback, and provides basic design tools for specifications of transient response. It also briefly covers frequency-domain techniques. This course includes laboratory experiments and a control design project.

Prerequisites/Corequisites
--------------------------

There are no formal prerequisites for this course; however you will need some knowledge of material from the following courses:

Concepts Covered in the Course
------------------------------

This is a list of {{% resource_link 1cd5fe9e-7d57-17e6-93dc-ad586158c439 "concepts covered in this course (PDF)" %}}. Please use this as a checklist on concepts to guide your study.

Learning Objectives
-------------------

*   Learn the process of modeling linear time-invariant (LTI) dynamical systems in dual domains: in the time domain using ordinary differential equations and in the Laplace domain (s-domain).
*   Understand the behavior of LTI systems qualitatively and quantitatively, both in the transient and steady-state regimes, and appreciate how it impacts the performance of electro-mechanical systems.
*   Introduce feedback control and understand, using the s-domain primarily, how feedback impacts transient and steady-state performance.
*   Learn how to design proportional, proportional-integral, proportional-derivative, and proportional-integral-derivative feedback control systems meeting specific system performance requirements.
*   Introduce qualitatively the frequency response of LTI systems and how it relates to the transient and steady-state system performance.
